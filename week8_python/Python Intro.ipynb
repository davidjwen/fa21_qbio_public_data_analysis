    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the Intro to Python tutorial! We'll be going over the nuts-and-bolts of the language, as well as some parts of the language especially useful for scientific programming. If you're already familiar with Python, you can skip the basics, and follow along in another jupyter notebook or file!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Basics\n",
    "Python is much more similar to a \"normal\" programming language (e.g. C++, Java) than R, so if you're gone through the core CS courses you're probably going to be a lot more comfortable with Python. Here's a quick runthrough of the syntax used to implement \"standard\" programming procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A First Note on Python as a Language\n",
    "Python tries to make things as \"intuitive\" as possible; they use the \"duck\" philosphy with regards to variables (if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck). Basically, the programmer (you!) gets all the power, and Python doesn't enforce any rules unless it breaks the language. The takeaway is to *be super clear with your variable and function naming*, because sometimes if you make a variable the wrong type, Python will still try to make the code work, which gives you a bad result without warning you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Variables\n",
    "Nothing particularly interesting here: just use the equals sign. Like R, you don't declare a variable as a specific type as you do in C++ (hence the duck typing)."

    "## A Syntaxical Note\n",
    "In the other programming languages you've used before (R, C++, etc.), you've probably defined code blocks using curly braces. Python is completely different, in that it uses a **colon, then indentation** to demark a new code block. You'll see this in the looping, control flow, and function parts of the guide. This means that Python forces you to maintain nicely readable code, so if you're sloppy with your indentation Python will swiftly punish you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you don't really have to worry about vectorized operations (though they're still much faster -- more on that in the scientific computation section). However, there's four main types of array data structures (collections) in base Python: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "* `lists` are your standard array data structure in Python (being ordered and changeable). They'll suffice for most of your purposes. You declare them using square brackets (`my_list = [1, 2, 3]`).\n",
    "* `tuples` are like `lists`, but they are **unchangeable**. They're helpful if you're optimizing code to maximize runtime, though you can in most cases just use `lists`. You declare them using parentheses. (`my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`).\n",
    "* `sets` are **unordered**, **unchangeable** collections. Also, you can't have duplicates in them. Again, you can probably ignore the existence of sets and just use lists most of the time. You declare them using curly brackets (`my_set = {1, 2, 3}`).\n",
    "* `dictionaries` are an associative data structure, having a `key` and `value` tuple (if you've taken 104, they're `maps`/hash tables). Essentially, they're a `set` (the key), where each element in the set is paired with some value. As such, they're also defined using curly brackets (`my_dict = {1:\"one\", 2:\"two\", 3:\"three\"}`). You're most likely to use these to associate some input with an output, and as such are very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Foreword: Objects\n",
    "We've managed to avoid talking about objects in the context of R, but Python makes us understand what objects are (because **literally everything** in Python is an object, including packages and functions). Very abstractly, an `object` is a specially-defined data type, and it has the following two attributes (i.e. it stores the following information):\n",
    "* Data attributes: these store variables.\n",
    "* Methods: these are functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access data attributes, use `object_name.attribute` (note the lack of parentheses). To call a function from an object, use `object_name.function()` (note that these have parentheses). We'll see this soon when working with lists, which are, in fact, examples of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Values\n",
    "To access the element at a specific index in a list, use square brackets as usual (`first_list[1]` is `1`, for example). *Note Python is 0-indexed, just like C++.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a range of values, use the colon (`:`). Note that the range is inclusive of the first index, but not of the second (as is standard in Python)."
